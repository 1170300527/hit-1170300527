## Style Guide

Apache Tomcat has very loosely defined coding conventions, but the following
guidelines will be useful:

* Use spaces for indenting, not tabs
* 100 char line width for Java source, 80 char line width for documentation
source (.txt, .xml)
* Java source: { at end of line, 4 space indents

## Did we miss something?

some particular step? If so, please let us know! Or better yet, submit a PR to
